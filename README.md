# Invest
Module 8 Journal Invest 
This is a simply application that shows how much money you could have if you invest Monthly.
I beleive that I created very clean code in this project and it looks extremely well. I could enhance it slightly
by adding more functionality like allowing to change the freuquency of investing/saving. I found the most challenging part
was creating the correct algorith for the interest aquried. I also beleive that creating the modular functionality could easily transfer to 
other projects and the knowledge of doing so. I made sure to add good comments so future developerfs could maintain and change
this code if they wanted to.
